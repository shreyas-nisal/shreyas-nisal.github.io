                        <p>Just as with React Native, one of the first apps I worked on in Flutter was a chat application. This time, I also decided to address some of the issues I had encountered with the React Native version of the app.<br><br>I used firebase for authentication and a realtime database, which improved the security aspect as well as the fact that the users could now receive messages without triggering events on their device (such as hitting refresh).<br><br>Other than the basic functionality wherein users could message each other, I also added a feature to create and chat in groups. The app also showed the date above a group of messages sent on one day, and the time with each message. The data/time display is also designed such that the sender and receiver can be in different time zones, and the date/time would be shown according to the time-zone that the user is in.</p>

                    <h2>&lt;Photo Journal&gt;</h2>
                    <div class="textcontainer">
                        <p>Built based on a challenge from a friend, the Photo Journal app was a weekend project. The app lets users upload their most treasured photos with a caption, and the home screen shows these photos in an instagram-like interface. The user can also set a date/time with the photo, and can delete existing posts. Photos posted in the app are only visible to them, since the photo journal was never meant to be a photo "sharing" application.<br><br>I used firebase for authentication, database, and photo storage, and a few flutter packages to allow users to pick images from the device storage. It was a fun exercise to develop a simple but complete app with an appealing user interface in such a short time, with a couple of iterations of major design changes to the database schema.</p>
